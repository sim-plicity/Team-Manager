## Telemetry Tab Overview

The Telemetry tab displays live data from your wheelbase in an organized, easy-to-read format:

**Main Display Areas:**
- **System Metrics**: Wheelbase performance and health information
- **Force Feedback Data**: Real-time FFB activity and effects
- **Connection Status**: USB and device communication information
- **Update Controls**: Background monitoring options

**What Telemetry Shows You:**
- **What's happening right now**: Current torque, ffb signal clipping, and system status
- **Performance trends**: How your wheelbase is behaving over time
- **Potential issues**: Early warning of problems before they affect your driving
- **System health**: Overall wheelbase condition and performance metrics

## Real-Time Performance Data

### Torque Information

**Current Torque:**
- **What it shows**: The exact amount of force being applied right now
- **Units**: Newton meters (Nm)
- **Normal range**: 0 to your maximum torque setting
- **What to look for**: Sudden spikes, drops, or constant high torque

**Maximum Torque:**
- **What it shows**: The highest torque reached since monitoring started
- **Why useful**: See how much force feedback your games are actually generating


### System Performance

**System Utilization:**
- **What it shows**: How much processing power the wheelbase is using
- **Percentage range**: 0-100%
- **Normal operation**: Usually under 60% during regular use
- **High values**: May indicate complex FFB effects or system strain

## System Information

### Device Status

**Connection Status:**
- **Online/Connected**: Wheelbase is properly connected and working
- **Offline/Disconnected**: No communication with wheelbase
- **Error Messages**: Specific problems that need attention

**Firmware Version:**
- **What it shows**: The software version running on your wheelbase
- **Why important**: Determines available features and compatibility
- **Updates**: New firmware may add features or fix issues

## Force Feedback Monitoring

**Clipping Detection:**
- **What it shows**: When FFB forces exceed your wheelbase's maximum capability
- **Problem indication**: You're losing detail when forces clip
- **Solution**: Lower game FFB strength or increase wheelbase torque settings
- **Visual indication**: Usually shown as a warning or colored indicator

## Background Monitoring

### Enable Background Updates

**What it does:**
- **Continuous monitoring**: Updates telemetry data even when tab isn't visible
- **Performance impact**: Very minimal system resource usage
- **Update frequency**: Typically every 2 seconds

**When to Use:**
- **Long racing sessions**: Monitor system health during endurance events
- **Troubleshooting**: Keep an eye on performance while driving
- **System tuning**: Watch effects of setting changes in real-time
- **Performance analysis**: Understand how different games stress your wheelbase
